# cdiff - compact diff

A lightweight utility for creating, applying, and inverting compact, single-coordinate diff patches. Designed for scenarios where patch readability and simplicity are crucial, with support for block operations to minimize patch size.

## What is this?

This library solves the problem of generating and applying text patches. Unlike standard diff formats, `cdiff` uses a simple, line-based  system. This means that each command (`Add` or `Delete`) refers to a line number in the *target* file state, making the patches easy to create and reason about.

### Key Features

* **Simple Format**: Patches are just an array of strings, easy to store (e.g., in JSON) and transfer.
* **Invertible**: Any patch can be inverted to roll back changes.
* **Block Operations**: Automatically groups consecutive additions or deletions into blocks (`A+`, `D+`) to make patches more compact.
* **Strict & Non-Strict Modes**: Choose whether to throw an error on a content mismatch during deletion or to log a warning and continue.
* **Cross-Platform**: Handles `\n` and `\r\n` line endings automatically.
* **Character-Level Diffs**: Automatically generates compact intra-line patches (`d`/`a`) for small changes within a line, reducing patch size and preserving change semantics.
* **Smart Multi-Line Handling**: Detects aligned multi-line replacements and applies character-level diffs per line when beneficial.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @fishan/cdiff
```

## API and Usage

### `createPatch(oldContent, newContent)`

Generates a compact patch by comparing two strings. The result may contain line, block, or character-level commands, depending on what is most efficient.

#### Example 1: Basic Line Replacement
```typescript
import { CdiffService } from 'cdiff';

const oldContent = 'line 1\nold line\nline 3';
const newContent = 'line 1\nnew line\nline 3';

const cdiff = CdiffService.createPatch(oldContent, newContent);
// Result: ['2 D old line', '2 A new line']
console.log(cdiff);
```
#### Example 2: Character-Level Change (Intra-Line)
```typescript
const oldContent = 'const x = 10;';
const newContent = 'const y = 10;';

const cdiff = CdiffService.createPatch(oldContent, newContent);
// Result: ['1 d 6 1 x', '1 a 6 1 y']
// Meaning: delete 'x' at index 6, insert 'y' at index 6
console.log(cdiff);
```
#### Example 3: Multi-Line Block Addition
```typescript
const oldContent = 'start\nend';
const newContent = 'start\nline A\nline B\nline C\nend';

const cdiff = CdiffService.createPatch(oldContent, newContent);
// Result:
// [
//   '2 A+ 3',
//   'line A',
//   'line B',
//   'line C'
// ]
console.log(cdiff);
```
#### Example 4: Aligned Multi-Line Replacement (Character-Level per Line)
```typescript
const oldContent = 'const a = 1;\nconst b = 2;';
const newContent = 'const a = 100;\nconst b = 200;';

const cdiff = CdiffService.createPatch(oldContent, newContent);
// Result (may vary slightly based on diff algorithm):
// [
//   '1 a 11 2 00',
//   '2 a 15 2 00'
// ]
console.log(cdiff);
```
### Direct Character-Level Patching with `CdiffCharService`

You can generate character-level patches **manually** for a single line without involving full-file diffing.

```typescript
import { CdiffCharService } from 'cdiff';

const oldLine = 'function foo() {';
const newLine = 'function bar() {';

const charPatch = CdiffCharService.createPatch(oldLine, newLine, 5); // line 5
// Result: ['5 d 9 3 foo', '5 a 9 3 bar']
console.log(charPatch);

// Apply it directly to a string
const result = CdiffCharService.applyPatch(oldLine, charPatch);
console.log(result); // 'function bar() {'
```

> ðŸ’¡ Use this when you already know **which line changed** and want maximum control or performance.

---


### `applyPatch(originalContent, cdiff, strictMode?, onWarning?)`

Applies any valid cdiff patch (line, block, or character-level).

```typescript
const original = 'alpha\nbeta\ngamma';
const cdiff = [
  '2 d 0 5 beta', // delete "beta"
  '2 a 0 4 new!'  // insert "new!" at start of line 2
];

const result = CdiffService.applyPatch(original, cdiff);
// Result: 'alpha\nnew!\ngamma'
console.log(result);
```

#### Handling Mismatches with `onWarning`

In non-strict mode (`strictMode: false`), you can capture warnings if a deletion command doesn't match the content. This example demonstrates how to collect and display these warnings.

```typescript
const warnings: string[] = [];

const patchedContent = CdiffService.applyPatch(
    originalFileContent,
    patchCommands,
    false, // non-strict mode
    (message) => {
        warnings.push(message); // Collect all warnings into an array
    }
);

if (warnings.length > 0) {
    // We have both the result and a list of problems that occurred.
    // Now we can show them to the user.
    alert("The patch was applied, but the following issues occurred:\n" + warnings.join('\n'));
}
```

### `invertPatch(cdiff)` + `applyInvertedPatch(...)`

Enables full round-trip patching: **apply â†’ invert â†’ restore**.

```typescript
const old = 'A\nB\nC';
const updated = 'A\nX\nY\nC';

// 1. Create patch
const patch = CdiffService.createPatch(old, updated);

// 2. Apply forward
const result = CdiffService.applyPatch(old, patch);
// result === updated

// 3. Invert patch
const inverted = CdiffService.invertPatch(patch);
// If patch was ['2 D B', '2 A X', '3 A Y'],
// inverted will be ['2 A B', '2 D X', '3 D Y']

// 4. Restore original
const restored = CdiffService.applyInvertedPatch(updated, inverted);
// restored === old
```

> âœ… Works seamlessly with **character-level commands** (`a` â†” `d`).

---

## Patch Format

The patch is an array of strings, where each string is a command.

* **Single-line Add**: `lineNumber A content`
    * Example: `3 A This is a new line`
* **Single-line Delete**: `lineNumber D content`
    * Example: `5 D This line will be removed`
* **Block Add**:
    * `lineNumber A+ count`
    * `content line 1`
    * `content line 2`
    * ...
* **Block Delete**:
    * `lineNumber D+ count`
    * `content line 1`
    * `content line 2`
    * ...
* **Character-Level Add**: `lineNumber a index length content`
    * Inserts `content` (of `length` characters) at `index` in the line.
    * Example: `2 a 6 1 y` â†’ inserts "y" at position 6 in line 2.
* **Character-Level Delete**: `lineNumber d index length content`
    * Deletes `length` characters starting at `index` from the line. The `content` field is the expected text to delete (for validation).
    * Example: `2 d 6 1 x` â†’ deletes "x" (length 1) at position 6 in line 2.

> ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Character-level commands (`a`/`d`) are automatically generated by `createPatch` when they produce a smaller patch than full-line replacements.

## Testing

The library is extensively tested to ensure reliability and robustness across various edge cases.
